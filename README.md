Making a math engine that can be help make life easier

Uptil now 
1) Functions
2) Polynomials
3) Vectors
4) Matrices (no determinant, inverse, eigen)
5) Complex Numbers

All of them have their individual plot functions

Tests in tests.py

Future 
1) Remainder of Matrix operations
2) Functional Polynomials
3) Transformations (Fourier, laplace, Power series approximation)
4) Differential Equations (computational approximations)
5) Gui
6) And more cool stuff...
